We have submitted two files of code. One for Question 2 and one for Question 3. For question 3 in Problem3.py line 33, if you uncomment
"or d >= 11" then the tree will be cut off at depth 10, otherwise it will build a full tree. In the terminal, executing the python file will build a full tree (~30min runtime) and print out the percent error for the full tree running the test instances.

For question 2 we coded it a bit differently in that ALL_INSTANCES combines X_TRAIN, Y_TRAIN into one array. Running Problem2.py from the terminal will build a full tree from the training data and plot a grid of values that are run through the tree to create a color grid showing the positive and negative boundaries. It will then create a plot using the majority vote of 101 trees in the same fashion.
