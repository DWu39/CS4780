Machine Learning projects

These are some of the files for the problem sets and the final project for our Machine Learning class. We implemented TDIDTs, kNN,
kMeans, Naive Bayes, and used Professor Joachim's SVM Light for reading in the data.

The final project was a music classication research project, with a playlist generation functionality using the Spotify API. We used EchoNest API to gather thousands of songs and experimented with the different features given by the API to maximize classication accuracy for several algorithms including TDIDTs, SVMs, and kNN. We discovered that SVMs in general performed best except for the classical music genre.
